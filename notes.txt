We can use pointsize to create a bitmap where the fragment
shader can draw in. But point boundaries may overlap, so it needs to run
for every point that overlaps a particular coordinate

maybe a particle effects shader example will help us.

1920x1080 1.9 million pixels

8 px radius for particle field = 1.9 / 16 / 16 = 7400 particles

but who knows??

we will create quads, one per particle, and use those to create a
field of forces. Then we'll move each particle within the field,
and redraw. 

The velocity, type, and position of each particle will each be 
stored in a corresponding texture.

We will access it by looking at pixel + 0.5 for each coordinate.
